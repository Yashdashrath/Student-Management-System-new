# Student-Management-System-
# 🎓 Student Management System

A simple and professional **Student Management System built using C++**.
This project demonstrates the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), STL Vector, File Handling, Functions, Iterators, and Input Validation**.

The system allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student records through an easy-to-use console interface.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

This project was created to practice important C++ programming concepts:

### Object-Oriented Programming

The project uses classes and objects to organize the application.

```cpp
class Student
{
    // Student information
};
```

and

```cpp
class StudentManagementSystem
{
    // Management operations
};
```

### STL Vector

Student records are dynamically stored using:

```cpp
vector<Student> students;
```

### File Handling

Student records are saved using:

```cpp
ofstream file(filename);
```

and loaded using:

```cpp
ifstream file(filename);
```

This allows student data to remain available even after closing the program.

## 📊 Example

### Adding a Student

```text
Enter Roll Number: 101
Enter Name: Ayush
Enter Branch: CE
Enter CGPA: 9.5

Student added successfully!
```

### Displaying Students

```text
Roll No   Name                Branch         CGPA
-------------------------------------------------------
101       Ayush               CE              9.5
102       Yash                CSE              9
103       Akshay              CE              9.7
```

### Average CGPA

```text
Average CGPA: 9.2
```

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

The application automatically stores student records inside:

```text
students.txt
```

For example:

```text
101 Ayush CE 9.5
102 Yash CSE 9
103 Akshay CE 9.7
```

When the program starts again, these records are automatically loaded.
